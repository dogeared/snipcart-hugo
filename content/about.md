  <p>I started baking when I was only three years old, and my grandmother taught me almost everything I know. Food is a symbol of love in our family, and to this day, I bake or cook for people to show them that I care about them. I have recipes passed down from three or four generations back, including my Great-Great-Grandma Sara’s strudel and my  Great-Grandma’s famous chocolate cake. </p>
  
  <p>I have worked in local bakeries before and I love to bake when I do have the time. I figured I would try to locally market my product (my recipes, of course, are not for sale!). </p>
  
  <p>I want to share the joy that I have felt when I have made delicious desserts for my family with anyone who would like to try my pastries. </p>
